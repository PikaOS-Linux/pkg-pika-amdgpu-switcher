# This script applies amdvlk-pro/amdvlk/radv Vulkan driver for specific application.
# You can see the list of available drivers with vulkaninfo utility, see the driverName and driverID lines.
# 
# Usage:
#   <vk_radv|vk_amdvlk|vk_pro> <app and its parameters>
# For example:
#   $ vk_pro vkmark
# This will start vkmark with AMDGPU PRO vulkan driver.

# When amdvlk is installed, then VK_ICD_FILENAMES is ignored and AMD_VULKAN_ICD is read instead. However, AMD_VULKAN_ICD does not allow you (afaics) select pro driver.
# So we revert this behavior to standard one.
