# This script applies amdogl-pro/zink/mesa OpenGL driver for specific application.
# You can test the difference (GL_VENDOR, GL_RENDERER, GL_VERSION) with glmark2 utility.
# 
# Usage:
#   <gl_mesa|gl_zink|gl_pro> <app and its parameters>
# For example:
#   $ gl_pro davinci-resolve
# This will start davinci resolve with AMDGPU PRO OpenGL driver.
